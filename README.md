# About So_Long ![antibiotic](./sprites/collectable.png)

So_Long is the first graphical project I have made during my 42 Network curriculum.
It's a 2D game that's made with minilibx where we use textures, sprites, tiles and linked lists.
I succeeded with 125/100 points.

## Theme: Lyme Disease ![ticks](./sprites/enemy.png)
Inspired by my personal experience with Lyme Disease, I've chosen it as the theme for my game.
Not just to raise awareness for Lyme, but it was definitely also a way for me to process my journey.

Players have been in contact with a tick and need to collect antibiotics to prevent this infectious disease.
Make sure to avoid the other ticks, because they'll give you a bullseye rash - it indicates a certain infection!
Treatment can include two kinds of antibiotics, so exit through the other antibiotic to make sure you can beat Lyme to the curb!
