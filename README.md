![Antibiotic](/Users/diwalaku/Desktop/so_long/sprites/collectable.png)

So_long is the first graphical project I have made during my 42 Network curriculum.
It's a 2D game that's made with minilibx where we use textures, sprites, tiles and linked lists.

As my theme, I chose Lyme Disease, where its collectables are antibiotics, the enemies are ticks
and the exit is another antibiotic, since treatment usually needs two kinds.

It can be a harsh disease and because of my first hand experience, I wanted to create something for it.
